# Project Discontinued #

No one is really working on this project.  If you are interested in taking this project over, please contact us.  Otherwise, feel free to look at the code and get some ideas and possibly just copy the code into your own project, appengine-homedir.py is relatively the best version I believe.

## Old description ##

This project is a set of replacement modules and monkeypatches to existing modules in the App Engine environment, to make it more like a normal Python environment.  This is to facilitate the use of existing libraries.

The place to start is the [Pylons](Pylons.md) introduction document.

Any feedback should take the form of [a ticket](http://code.google.com/p/appengine-monkey/issues/list).
